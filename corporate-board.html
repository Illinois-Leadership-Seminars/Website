                            <p>Austin attended the Illinois Leadership Seminar in the summer of 2006 and has been
                                actively involved ever since. He served as Alumni Association President before taking
                                over as Recruitment Director on the Seminar Planning Committee. For the last 5 years,
                                Austin has recruited hundreds of outstanding young leaders for ILS and he loves
                                interacting with parents and students who have no clue what they just got themselves
                                into. In addition to ILS, Austin interacts with sister seminars in other states through
                                the National Society for Youth Leadership (NSYL). He believes that one of the greatest
                                benefits of attending ILS is the opportunity to become part of not only a state-wide
                                support system, but a national leadership network. Austin graduated from the University
                                of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a Bachelor’s degree in Actuarial Science.</p>
