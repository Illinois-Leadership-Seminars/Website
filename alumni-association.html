                <h3>Friends for a Lifetime</h3>
                <p>ILS is very proud to have an active network of alumni who promote youth leadership all year round in
                    various ways. So, tell me, who are alumni? And what does an alumni do? Those are great questions!
                    Alumni are students who have participated in any one of the ILS Flagship Seminars or iLeads!
                    The alumni association itself is governed by leaders under 21 years old; however, activities and
                    events involve all alumni, even those over 21. This supports the continuous cultivation of alumni as
                    they grow in their leadership abilities and experiences and allows for greater mentorship
                    opportunities as time goes on.</p>

                <p>Why do we have an alumni association? Another great question! The Illinois Leadership Seminars
                    engages with some of the best student leaders all over the state! In today's globally connected
                    world, students need and want an avenue in which they can network with all types of leaders. The
                    best part about this is that we provide alumni opportunities to network with Leaders not only from
                    Illinois, but also with any Leaders from a state that is associated with National Society for Youth
                    Leadership (NSYL). This list includes the states of California, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota,
                    Missouri, Ohio and Wisconsin!</p>

                <p>The ILS Alumni Association is active throughout the year in many ways. In addition to monthly
                    meetings, alumni organize and lead reunions, fundraisers, community service activities, and also
                    participate in their own leadership programming. The alumni also plan iLeads.</p>
